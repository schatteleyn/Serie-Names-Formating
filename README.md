Serie Names Formatting
======================

Little script in Ruby to format the title of the files of your series.
The script will ask you for the name of the serie and the directory of it, and will then rename the files.

## TO-DO: ##
+ Handle errors
+ Handle more case with regex
+ See if I can make it works in several directories in one shot
